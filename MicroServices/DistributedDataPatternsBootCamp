According to Marc Andreesen, Software is eating the world.
Everything is being done now by software and at the same time the market
forces that govern the industries and getting more complex and demand faster response.
Thus, the software we need to build needs to cater to these market needs.
Thus there are 2 important metrics to measure:
(1) Velocity
    - Lead time: Time between when a developer commits code and when it is deployed in prod.
    -Deployments: Number of deployments per dev per day
(2) Reliability
    -Number of defects per change  - how many defects are introduced per change
    -Mean time to resolve defects - how long does it take to resolve defects
